## Modeling
### DAX
* [Visual calculations](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/transform-model/desktop-visual-calculations-overview) - A visual calculation is a DAX calculation defined and executed directly on a visual. Visual calculations make it easier to create calculations that were previously hard to create, leading to simpler DAX, easier maintenance, and better performance.
* [Quick measures](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/transform-model/desktop-quick-measures) - You can use quick measures to quickly and easily perform common, powerful calculations. A quick measure runs a set of Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) commands behind the scenes, then presents the results for you to use in your report.
